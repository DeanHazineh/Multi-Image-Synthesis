If you downloaded the Dflat github, you will likely already have some of these model files. 
- They are stored here since the ERBF and Poly models are included in the github to save memory (given that we opt to use the MLP instead). 
- The code used to train these models is in the github however. See Dflat/dflat/neural_optical_layer/core/
